# CRYPTOCORE
This Repository is a Clone of the SphereServer X version available here: [SOURCEX](https://github.com/Sphereserver/Source-X) 

## Why a clone/fork?
This version of Sphere is use on Ultima online [Cryptonite Shard](https://www.uocryptonite.com/).
We decide to fork this branch because some little modification are made for adapting our gameplay.


#### Here the list of difference between the reel sphere X:

1.  Cryptonite use c_gargoyle_male and female as custom dwarf. We need to avoid the gargoyle anim and force human anim.
2.  Insubtantial flags is use on some class (CL) during a small period. We must modify  that the player is see like a death player.
3.  Emote message over NPC/player head is crap and long. "YOU SEE NAME" is useless. We remove all name and pronom. (important to modify msg.scp in script too)
